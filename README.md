## Introduction
This is the official TCG reference implementation of the [TPM 2.0 Specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/tpm-library-specification). The project contains complete source code of the reference implementation with various [Build Options](#build-instructions).

This repository includes a  [TPM 2.0 simulator](TPMCmd/Simulator) that emulates a TPM 2.0 device and can be accessed via a custom TCP based protocol.  This allows experimentation and testing of the reference code.  The simplest way to work with the simulator is to use a [TSS library](https://github.com/Microsoft/TSS.MSR) for the programming language of your choice - C#/.Net, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript/Node.js are currently supported. The C language TSS implementing the TCG's TSS API specification is available [here](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss).
